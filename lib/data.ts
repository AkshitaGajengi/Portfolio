Numbers tell stories, and I'm here to translate them. As a Business Analytics grad student at Northeastern, I'm on a mission to turn data into decisions that matter.
Whether I'm boosting hotel bookings by 25% or optimizing marketing ROI, I love seeing how data can make a real-world impact. From crunching numbers in SQL to crafting eye-catching visualizations in Power BI, I'm all about making sense of the data puzzle.
When I'm not deep in datasets, you might catch me commentating on women's soccer or brainstorming the next big marketing strategy for a music festival.
Want to chat about how we can use data to shake things up in your industry? Let's grab a virtual coffee and geek out over some analytics!`
